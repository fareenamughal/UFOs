# UFOs Analysis using JavaScript, HTML and Bootstrap 
[Module 12]
___

## Overview of Project 
___

Dana's webpage and dynamic table aims to provide an interactive analysis for users that would provide them with information about UFO sightings based on the criteria they input. In the previous practice exercise we used one selection criteria to filter the data. In this project we will add multiple filter criteria, thereby allowing users to see only what they are interested in. To be specific, in addition to the date filter, city, state, country and shape will also be used to filter throught the UFO sighting database.

### Results
___


The webpage is divided into two sections:
--- The static section of the webpage
--- The dynamic section of the webpage

  1. The static section of the webpage contains information - text, images, data etc that does not change. Users cannot make changes to this section. The webpage developer or owner would be able to change this section via the Bootstrap CSS library which would formt according to the selected CSS library, image file based on the preferred image and text based on the specific text that for the website.

  2. The dynamic section of the webpage contains information which changes as per user selection. In this case the dynamic section contains the various filters which refer to columns in the data table. A user can search the data based on the following criteria:
  ---Date - denotes the date that the user would like to drill down thier search for
  ---City - this is to select the specific city of interest
  ---State - enables a user to select the one specific state
  ---Country - this data contains information for only one country, US. If the data contained information about more countries then users would be able to select a specific country and observe results for the selected counrty 
  ---shape - this enables the users to select the type of shape for instance triangle - of the UFO sightings.

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
